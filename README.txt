#Jetwise Airline - Microservices Project
Jetwise Airline is a Spring Boot microservices project designed for learning and real-world simulation.
It demonstrates concepts like role-based access, service segregation, database integration, validation, exception handling, JWT authentication, scheduled jobs, asynchronous processing, and cloud-native features.

## Services Overview

Each microservice runs independently with its own database and port.

| Service Name        | Port    | Base URL                           | Description                              |
|---------------------|---------|------------------------------------|------------------------------------------|
| **user-service**    | 8081    | http://localhost:8081/api/users    | Handles user registration, login, roles, JWT authentication |
| **flight-service**  | 8082    | http://localhost:8082/api/flights  | Manage flights (search, list, create, update) |
| **booking-service** | 8083    | http://localhost:8083/api/bookings | Booking creation, pending status handling, scheduled jobs, Ticket generation after payment success |
| **payment-service** | 8084    | http://localhost:8084/api/payments | Payment processing |
| **jwt-common**      |(Library)|                -                   | Shared JWT utility dependency for all services |

---
🗄️ Database: All services use a single MySQL instance with multiple schemas (user-service, flight-service, booking-service, payment-service

---

## JWT-Common Module Overview

The jwt-common project is a shared library that provides reusable JWT-related components for all microservices.

### Purpose:
To ensure consistent JWT token generation, validation, and claims management across services — reducing code duplication.


### Features:
Common JwtTokenProvider for token creation & validation
Shared JwtAuthenticationFilter
JwtUtils for extracting username/roles
Centralized JWT exception handling
Added as a Maven dependency in all other microservices

##  Architecture & Design

Microservices Architecture: Each service has its own responsibility and schema, can be deployed independently.

API Gateway: Routes incoming requests to respective services.

Service Discovery: Eureka Server enables services to locate each other dynamically.

Asynchronous Tasks: Background tasks for PDF generation and emails.

Scheduled Jobs: Booking service automatically cancels pending bookings after 10 minutes.

Containerization: Each service can be run in Docker for easy deployment and scaling.
